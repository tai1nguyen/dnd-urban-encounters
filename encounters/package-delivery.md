### Hook
While navigating the busy streets of the town, the characters notice a local courier in a state of stress.

>You spy a man holding a large wrapped box in his hands. He is sweating and leaning against the side of a building, catching his breath. The man sports a blue and silver uniform that tells you he is a courier.
>
>After several seconds he places the box down and sits on it. His head swivels back and forth on his neck as he scans around him for something. From amidst the crowd your eyes meet and he immediately waves you over...

### A Persuer in the Crowd
As the characters make their way to the merchant's home they leave the tight alley ways and streets of smaller neighborhoods and merge into the bustling crowd of the city's main throughfares. A character who succeeds a DC 10 passive Wisdom (Perception) check notices that they are being followed, by a single individual.

The thief does not make a move against the characters and only observes them for several minutes before disappearing back into the crowd.

### Down the Alley
The characters will naturally arrive at an alley. They are stopped by several hooded figures. Two are standing behind the characters, blocking their exit and one is standing in front of them. The man in front is larger that the two men behind the characters. He is well built and demands that they hand over the package to him.

If the characters refuse the three men attack. The characters may also attempt to flee from the thieves, use the [chase complications table]() to determine the complication, difficulty class and ability test needed to be overcome by each character. On a success, that particular character is closer to losing the theives. The characters escape once a character succeeds 5 complications. A character is caught once they have failed 3 complications.

>While the characters are attempting to resolve the conflict with the thieves, periodically make DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics or Sleight of Hand) checks to determine if the package was damaged or opened.

### Conclusion
The characters complete the job and deliver the package to the wealthy merchant. If the package was not damaged or opened, the merchant pays the characters 100 gp each and thanks them. Otherwise, the merchant is very upset and does not reward the characters.

The characters then have the option to link back up with the courier to split the reward with him.
