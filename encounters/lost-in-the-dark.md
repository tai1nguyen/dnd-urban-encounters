### Hook
While enjoying drinks at the local tavern, the characters spot a small child making their way across the crowded room.

>You notice a small tiefling child squeezing in through the door.
>
>The girl has noticeable filth on her dark brown hair and stains of varying color cover her dress in uneven patches. A distinct stench of rot and decay emenate from her as she made her way past the tables and diners. As she moved through the tavern she asks any one she comes across for help. Most ignore her, some, visibily disgusted at her appearance, leave.
>
>For a second your eyes meet and she begins to head in your direction. She stops just short of you, almost aware of her current condition, and asks politely for your help...

### Madeg's predicament
The tiefling child introduces herself as Madeg and spares no time in explaining the situation. She is worried about the wellbeing of her brother and asks the characters to help her find him in the sewers.

Madeg explains how her and her little brother got separated with in the sewers, and will agree to show the characters to the sewer entrance she used. Madeg, however, will not enter the sewers due to the tramua she experienced earlier that day.

If the characters refuse to help Madeg, she leaves in tears and her brother is never seen again. Days later, news of the characters refusal to help the child spreads throughout the city and their reputation suffers from it.

## Sewers Interior
The following areas correspond to the labels on the provided map.

### 1. Entrance Room [^](#content)
No matter how hard they try, the smell of sewage seeps into the nose of anyone that enters this room.

There are garbage and trash piled into the center of the room. A hole in the ceiling sits directly over the pile of refuse.

The room has three doors leading outwards. They are all shut. One door sits on the eastern wall and the other on the western wall. A grated door stands to the north. Water from the empty room (area 2) seeps through the door and into this room. It is too dark to see into the room on the other side of this door.

The grated door is operated via a system of pullies and can only be opened by being pushed and held up off the ground. 

A crank sits to the left of the grated door. It is stuck and a character succeeding a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check is able to force it to turn, opening the grated door. A character beating a DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check may hold the door up long enough for everyone to move through it.

The door to the west and stuck and cannot be open without force.

### 2. Empty Room [^](#content)
In the center of the room is a large pile of garbage. A swarm of rats is hidden within it. The rats attack if any characters inspect or approaches the pile of rubbish.

The door to the west of the room is close but not locked. The room opens to the east into the big empty room. The door at the south is grated and the entrance room can be seen.

### 3. Ruined Temple [^](#content)
The room is filled with sharp debris and trash, characters moving in this room must succeed a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage from the hidden debris.

An altar sits against the western wall. The candles stationed on it have long since gone out. A chest is hidden under the altar.

The chest contains 10d6 gp and a book written in an unknown language.

The room opens up to the north to the flood room (area 4), and a door to the east separates this room from (area 2). The room opens up to the south to the abandoned alchemist lab (area 5).

### 4. Flooded Room [^](#content)
The walls to this room are surprisingly clean. Aside from the sewer water leaking onto the floor, this room is unnecessarily tidy.

As the characters explore, an ooze rises from the murky water and attacks. A character must succeed a DC 15 passive Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the ooze before it strikes.

The room opens up in the south towards the ruined temple (area 3).

### 5. Abandoned Alchemist Lab [^](#content)
Junk and trash are scattered all around the room making it difficult for the characters to see where they are going. Characters moving in this room must succeed a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage from the hidden debris.

Arron stands on a small alchemy table, he is clutching a small club and is surprised to see the characters. The two rats that had him cornered are hidden in the corners of the room. As soon as the characters enter the rats attack.

The alchemy table has miscellaneous ingredients that are too wasted away to be of use.

The room opens up to the north to the ruined temple (area 3). The door to the east is shut.

### 6. Big Empty Room [^](#content)
There are more piles of garbage in this room. The smell of rotting meat and feces in this rooms makes the characters want to vomit. Characters entering this room must succeed a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or vomit loudly.

Four giant rats have made their home here and when a character enters the center of the room, or make a loud noise, the rats pour out to defend their home.

This room opens to the empty room (area 2) to the north west. The door to the south west is shut and leads back to the entrance room (area 1).
