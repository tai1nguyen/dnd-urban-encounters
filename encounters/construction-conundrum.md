## Description
Whester, a local construction foreman, stumbles into the bar late one night and requests help from anyone that will listen. His construction crew has been working on tearing down an old warehouse on the wharf but recently a gray beast with wings has been harrassing the nightshift workers.

The City Watch was informed and have committed to helping him but they are not experts and have been unable to deal with the beast.

### Hook
While enjoying a drink at the local tavern, a dwarf gathers the attention of all the current patrons.

>A barrel chested dwarf stumbles through the tavern doors. He wears clothes marking him as part of the Builders Guild. He slowly makes his way over to the bar. Upon closer inspection you can tell that the man is clearly exhuasted.
>
>After downing his drink, and finding his courage, the man gets up on his chair and introduces himself to the tavern as Whester, the local construction foreman. He explains that he and his team of builders have been tasked with demolishing an aging warehouse down by the wharf. Unfortunately, shortly after the work began his men were attacked by a wild beast. The creature only appears at night and has killed three of his men so far.
>
>He has informed the City Watch but they are not properly equipped to handle such a beast. Two of the City Watch have already fallen trying to take down the creature. Whester has ran out of options and he asks if anyone in this tavern is willing to help him take down the damned beast.

### The Construction Site
Whester will take the characters to the construction site immediately when they agree to help them. If it is currently daytime, the streets leading up to the site are busy and the area around it is full of people going about their day.

The construction site is nested between two other warehouses, each one a tall and imposing feature of the wharf. Across the street to the warehouses are businesses and office buildings. Trash litter the road between them.

On one of the office buildings are two gargoyles. Characters that succeed a DC 10 passive Wisdom (Perception) check notices that the statues appear to be newer and have less wear than the rest of the building they are attached to.

Characters that investigate the construction site will notice claw marks on equipement and the ground. A character succeeding a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check finds several stone fragements on the ground that do not seem to belong to anything at the site.

Whester, will remind the characters that the creature only comes out at night and when construction is underfoot.

### The Site at Night
If the characters decide to wait till night time to investigate the construction site they will notice that the area leading up to the site is generally empty and quiet. Investigations at the construction site at this time reveals the same information as if it had been investigated in the day.

After several minutes, Whester will get impatient with the creature and will begin to openly taunt it. The noise will draw in the gargoyle that has been attacking his crew.

## Conclusion
Whester will thank the characters for helping him get rid of the gargoyle harrassing his team. He offers to help the characters fix up or make additions to their place of business, or home, at a discounted price.
