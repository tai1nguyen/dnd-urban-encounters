## Description
As the characters go about their day, a tax offical mistakens a character in the party for a known tax evader. He starts to hound the characters and demand that they pay their dues.

The tax collector will not take "no" for an answer and will not leave them alone until they either, flee and successfully lose him in the city streets, or repay the sum of coin he demands.

### Hook
While navigating the busy streets, a tax collector notices a character and approaches.

>You walk down Fifth Avenue and across the street you spy a man dressed in a fine green and gold uniform. It takes several moments before you realize that the uniform belongs to the tax collection arm of the government. Your eyes briefly meet before you turn the corner and head down a separate road.
>
>You get ten paces in before you hear a voice calling you from behind. You turn to see the tax collector hurrying over to you.
>
>"I recognize you!", says the man. You can tell he is irritated, despite this being your first meeting with him.
>
>"It's time you pay up," he extends an open hand. "I won't be tricked again!"
>
>You explain that he is mistaken but he won't have any of it. He threatens to call the City Watch if you do not pay him the taxes he believes you owe.

### The Converstation
The man is visibly agitated, he has been tricked before and the sting from it is still fresh in his mind. He will not let the characters move on without first paying a tax of 500 gp. When the characters try to convince him that he is speaking to the wrong person, he will immediately make a scene and start calling for the City Watch.

At this point the characters should run. If they wait for the City Watch to arrive, they will be arrested.

### On the Run
As the characters flee, use the [chase complications table]() to determine the complication, difficulty class and ability test needed to be overcome by each character. On a success, that particular character is closer to losing the tax collector. The characters escape once a character succeeds 5 complications. A character is caught once they have failed 3 complications.

## Conclusion
If the characters escape they meet up back at the local tavern, or some other predetermined meeting place, and enjoy a round of beer. Otherwise, if a character has been caught, they will be taken down to the Govern District and charged with a misdemeanor. They are released and return to the tavern a little bit after the other characters have arrived. Characters caught by the City Watch now owes the city 150 gp for fleeing from a representative of the law.

Regardless of the outcome, the characters failed to restock their meat reserves and will have to do so some other day.
